sudo usermod -aG [groupName] username

usermod
This is the command used to modify a user account.

-a (append)
This option means “append” the user to the group(s) specified.
Without -a, the user will be removed from all other groups not listed in the command.

-G (groups)
This specifies which group(s) the user should be added to.
In this case, we are adding the user to the sudo group.


username
This is the name of the user you want to modify.

	groupadd groupname

	getent group [groupName]

	to list all groups existed
	getent group


				 VM CONFIGURATION & SSH SETUP
 				 VIRTUALBOX / HOST SETUP
 
 `VBoxManage list vms`                                             								 Lists all registered VirtualBox VMs on your system.                        

 `VBoxManage showvminfo "YOURVM"`                                  					 Displays detailed info about your VM, including NAT port forwarding rules. 

 `VBoxManage modifyvm "YOURVM" --natpf1 "ssh4242,tcp,,2222,,4242"` 			 Adds a NAT port forwarding rule: host port 2222 → guest port 4242.        

 `VBoxManage modifyvm "YOURVM" --natpf1 delete "ssh4242"`         				 Deletes an existing NAT port forwarding rule by name.                      

" Set network adapter to **NAT**  in the vm manager"                                  							Ensures port forwarding will work.                                         

 Add port forwarding rule (GUI)                                    								 Links host port 2222 to guest port 4242 via TCP.                           



 					Inside the Debian VM
				 SYSTEM & NETWORK SETUP


 `sudo ss -tuln | grep 4242`    			 Shows if SSH is listening on port 4242 (should return listening sockets). 

 `sudo systemctl status ssh`    		 	 Shows whether the SSH server is running.                                                                                   

 `sudo systemctl restart ssh`     			 Restarts the SSH server (after config changes).                                                                            

 `ip a`                          						 Lists all network interfaces and IP addresses.                                                                             

 `passwd`                         					 Changes the current user's password.                                                                                    

 `whoami`                         					 Displays the current username.                                                                                            

 `cat /etc/os-release`            				 Shows the OS version and distro info.                                                                                   

 `sudo poweroff` or `sudo reboot` 			 Shuts down or reboots the VM safely.                                                                                       




					 SSH CONFIGURATION     
                                   

 `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`                  		 Opens SSH config file to change port, root login, etc.         

 Edit: `Port 4242`                                 				 Changes SSH listening port from default 22 to 4242.            

 Edit: `PermitRootLogin no` or `prohibit-password` 	 Disables root login via SSH for security.                      

 Edit: `PasswordAuthentication yes`                		 Enables password login (if needed).                            
 
 `sudo nano` instead of `chmod`                    			 Correct way to edit protected system files.                    



				On the Host Machine
				SSH & Port Forwarding Test


 `ssh -p 2222 user@localhost`    							Connects from host to guest VM via port forwarding.         

`ssh -v -p 2222 user@localhost` 							Runs SSH with verbose output for debugging.                 

 `nc -vz localhost 2222`         								Tests if port 2222 is open and accepting connections.       

`telnet localhost 2222`         								Alternative port connectivity test (if `telnet` installed). 

You cannot `sudo lsof -i :2222`            									Shows processes listening on host port 2222.

Each file or directory has three sets of permissions:

User (u) – the file owner

Group (g) – users in the same group

Others (o) – everyone else

Each set has 3 types of permissions:

r – read

w – write

x – execute (or access directory)

✅ Check Current Permissions
ls -l filename


Example:

-rwxr-xr--  1 root root  1234 Aug 28 12:00 script.sh


Breakdown:

Owner: rwx (read/write/execute)

Group: r-x (read/execute)

Others: r-- (read only)

🔧 Changing Permissions

Use the chmod command.

📌 Syntax:
chmod [who][+|-|=][permissions] filename

🔹 Give Permissions
chmod u+x filename    # Give execute to user
chmod g+w filename    # Give write to group
chmod o+r filename    # Give read to others

🔹 Remove Permissions
chmod u-x filename    # Remove execute from user
chmod g-w filename    # Remove write from group
chmod o-r filename    # Remove read from others

🔹 Set Exact Permissions
chmod u=rw filename    # User gets only read+write (not execute)
chmod go= filename     # Group and others get no permissions

🧮 Using Numeric (Octal) Permissions

Each permission has a number:

r = 4

w = 2

x = 1

Example:
chmod 755 filename


Breakdown:

7 = 4+2+1 → user: rwx

5 = 4+0+1 → group: r-x

5 = 4+0+1 → others: r-x

Another example:

chmod 640 filename


→ user: rw-, group: r--, others: ---

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Changing Ownership (User or Group)

To change who owns a file:

chown username filename


To change group ownership:

chown :groupname filename


Or both at once:

chown username:groupname filename

🧪 Examples
Give a user execute permission on a script:
chmod u+x script.sh

Remove write permission from others:
chmod o-w myfile.txt

Change ownership of a file to alice:
chown alice report.txtur Debian VM:

						sudo journalctl -u ssh -f


			To see recent SSH log entries without following, use:
						sudo journalctl -u ssh --no-pager

			To search for ufw program
						sudo find / -type f -name ufw 2>/dev/null


			deny incoming: Blocks all incoming connections (good security default)
			allow outgoing: Allows the VM to connect out (e.g., internet, SSH from VM)

						sudo ufw default deny incoming
						sudo ufw default allow outgoing

			SSH on port 4242, allow port 4242 
						sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp
						
			to enable firewall :
						sudo ufw enable
			
			to check status of ufw :
						sudo ufw status
						
			to make a .sh file run like ./this
						chmod +x monitor_resources.sh

Got it 👍 You want to **wipe the whole LAMP/LEMP-like stack** (Apache, Lighttpd, PHP, MariaDB, FastCGI) from your system and start clean. I’ll give you a safe, step-by-step way.

---

## 🔥 Step 1: Stop running services

Before uninstalling, stop everything so it won’t interfere:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
sudo systemctl stop lighttpd
```

---

## 🔥 Step 2: Remove Apache

```bash
sudo apt purge apache2 apache2-utils apache2-bin apache2.2-common -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
```

---

## 🔥 Step 3: Remove Lighttpd

```bash
sudo apt purge lighttpd -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
```

---

## 🔥 Step 4: Remove PHP and FastCGI modules

```bash
sudo apt purge php* libapache2-mod-php* php-cgi php-fpm -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
```

This removes:

* PHP interpreter
* FastCGI bindings (`php-cgi`, `php-fpm`)
* Any PHP extensions you installed (`php-mysql`, etc.)

---

## 🔥 Step 5: Remove MariaDB

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
sudo apt purge mariadb-server mariadb-client mariadb-common mariadb-server-core-* mariadb-client-core-* -y
sudo apt autoremove --purge -y
```

⚠️ This removes the MariaDB server **but leaves your database files** in `/var/lib/mysql`.

If you want to **delete ALL databases permanently**:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql
sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql
```

---

## 🔥 Step 6: Clean config and logs

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/apache2
sudo rm -rf /etc/lighttpd
sudo rm -rf /etc/php
sudo rm -rf /var/log/apache2
sudo rm -rf /var/log/lighttpd
sudo rm -rf /var/log/mysql
```

---

## 🔥 Step 7: Verify removal

Check if anything is still running:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo lsof -i :3306
```

If nothing shows up → you’re clean. 🎉

---

✅ At this point, your system has **no Apache, no Lighttpd, no PHP, no FastCGI, no MariaDB, no configs, no databases**. It’s like a fresh install.

---

Do you want me to also give you a **clean re-installation guide for Lighttpd + PHP + MariaDB only (without Apache at all)** so you can rebuild from scratch the correct way?
